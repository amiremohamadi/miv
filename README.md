#### Currently under heavy development

## What is Miv?
Miv is a **STUPID** text editor. The term **"Miv"** has no meaning and is just a play on words with **"Vim"**! 

It has no superiority over other editors and only is developed for personal purposes!

> "This is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files. All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type with ten fingers can work very fast" :)

## Compiling
All you need is to run the `makefile`.

## Requirements
- ncurses

## Copying
Available to anybody free of charge, under the terms of GPL V.2 License.
